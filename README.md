# CityBin Smart Toolkit 🚮🌐

**CityBin Smart Toolkit** is an innovative IoT-based smart garbage management system developed as a capstone project at the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. The system aims to modernize and optimize waste collection for municipalities, businesses, and households through real-time monitoring, AI-driven route optimization, and community engagement features.

## 📌 Project Overview

The CityBin Smart Toolkit combines hardware and software to improve how waste is managed. It enables authorities to monitor garbage bins in real-time, reduce unnecessary trips, and promote efficient garbage collection.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor bin fill-levels in real-time using ultrasonic sensors.
- Notify waste collectors and users through customizable alerts.
- Optimize garbage collection routes using AI algorithms.
- Provide analytics through an intuitive dashboard.
- Encourage responsible waste disposal through a reward system.
